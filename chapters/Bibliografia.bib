abstract="Detecting anomalies in satellite telemetry data is pivotal in ensuring its safe operations. Although there exist various data-driven techniques for the task of determining abnormal parts of the signal, they are virtually never validated over real telemetries. Analyzing such data is challenging due to its intrinsic characteristics, as telemetry may be noisy and affected by incorrect acquisition, resulting in missing parts of the signal. In this paper, we tackle this issue and propose a machine learning approach for detecting anomalies in single-channel satellite telemetry. To validate its capabilities in a practical scenario, we build a dataset capturing the nominal and anomalous telemetry data captured on board OPS-SAT---a nanosatellite launched and operated by the European Space Agency. Our extensive experimental study showed that the proposed algorithm offers high-quality anomaly detection in real-life satellite telemetry, reaching 98.4{\%} accuracy over the unseen test set.",

abstract="The analysis of time series data is of high relevance in fields like manufacturing, health, automotive, or science. In this paper, we propose ROCKAD, a kernel-based approach for semi-supervised whole time series anomaly detection, i.e. the assignment of a single anomaly score to an entire time series. Our key idea is to use ROCKET as an unsupervised feature extractor and to train a single as well as an ensemble of k-nearest neighbors anomaly detectors to deduce an anomaly score. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to transfer the ideas of ROCKET to the task of anomaly detection. We systematically evaluate ROCKAD for univariate time series and show it is statistically significantly better compared to baseline methods. Additionally, we show in a case study that ROCKAD is also applicable to multivariate time series.",

abstract = {As spacecraft send back increasing amounts of telemetry data, improved anomaly detection systems are needed to lessen the monitoring burden placed on operations engineers and reduce operational risk. Current spacecraft monitoring systems only target a subset of anomaly types and often require costly expert knowledge to develop and maintain due to challenges involving scale and complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), in overcoming these issues using expert-labeled telemetry anomaly data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover, Curiosity. We also propose a complementary unsupervised and nonparametric anomaly thresholding approach developed during a pilot implementation of an anomaly detection system for SMAP, and offer false positive mitigation strategies along with other key improvements and lessons learned during development.},
